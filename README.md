# SQL_Project_GoldenAges_of_VideoGames
In this project, I'll analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. We'll search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and we'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.

My search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I also filter, group, and order data using SQL.

## Skills covered:

- Table Joins: Efficiently combine data from multiple database tables using various types of joins, such as LEFT JOIN and INNER JOIN.

- Data Aggregation: Using aggregate functions like COUNT, AVG, and SUM to summarize and analyze large datasets.

- Data Sorting: Sorting query results based on specified columns in ascending or descending order to present data in a meaningful way.

- Data Filtering: Using WHERE and HAVING clauses to filter and extract specific subsets of data based on given conditions.

- Alias and Column Renaming: Providing meaningful aliases for columns and renaming them to improve the readability of query results.

- Subqueries: Familiar with using subqueries to create intermediate result sets and leverage them in the main query to solve complex problems.
